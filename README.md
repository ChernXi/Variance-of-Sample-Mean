# Variance-of-Sample-Mean

Variance of "Sample Mean" is not the variance of population.
Sample mean is that the mean by taking some samples from the populations and find its average.
If we repeat this process many times, since we may take different samples each time, we may get many different sample means.
If we want to obtain some quantitative measurements about how far are these sample means different from each other, we may take the variance of sample mean.

As we could perceive, the more times we repeat the experiment, the more reliable is our mean of sample mean, on the others word, the variance of sample mean will decrease. After numerous times of sampling, we get our mean of sample mean approaches the population mean, and the variance of sample mean approaches zero.

The formula for variance of sample mean is

$$ Variance\\;of\\;the\\;sample\\;mean,\\;Var(\bar{X}) = \frac{Variance\\;of\\;the\\;polulation}{number of experiment} $$
